# "X Nimmt" game simulator
`npm install`

`npm run dev`

The whole programme has been packed into a single file, `index.html`, which is the only file that needs to be served. The rest of the files are for development purposes only.

Using electron, the programme can be run as a desktop application. To do so, run `npm run electron:serve`, or use the pre-built executables in the `dist_electron` folder.
